# Heartbeat Checklist

## Always

- [ ] If `BOOTSTRAP.md` exists in workspace, follow it first. Do not continue with the rest of this checklist until bootstrap is complete.
- [ ] Check memory files for any pending research requests or follow-ups.
- [ ] If nothing needs attention, write a short memory update and return `HEARTBEAT_OK`.
