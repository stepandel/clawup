# Heartbeat Checklist

## Always

- [ ] Check Linear for tickets assigned to me in "Todo" or "Backlog" status that haven't been prepped yet — for each one, run the `linear-ticket-prep` skill to prepare it for work
- [ ] If any assigned ticket is missing a description or acceptance criteria, flag it and ask the assigner for clarification
- [ ] Once prepped, assign the ticket to Titus and move it to "To Do" status
