# Heartbeat Checklist

## Always

- [ ] If `BOOTSTRAP.md` exists in workspace, follow it first. Stop here until complete.
- [ ] Check your Linear queue (`linear_queue peek`) and Linear for tickets assigned to me in "Todo" or "Backlog" that haven't been prepped yet
- [ ] For each unprepped ticket, run the `linear-ticket-routing` skill to determine process and assignee
- [ ] If any ticket is missing a description or acceptance criteria, flag it and ask the assigner for clarification
