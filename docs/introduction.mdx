# Agent Army

Agent Army lets you deploy a fleet of [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) AI agents on your own cloud infrastructure — AWS or Hetzner — with a single command.

## Why Agent Army?

Running AI agents in production requires infrastructure: servers, networking, persistent storage, secure credential management, and orchestration. Agent Army handles all of this so you can focus on what your agents do, not where they run.

## Key Features

## How It Works

1. **Configure** — Run `agent-army init` to set up your stack, choose a provider, select agents
2. **Deploy** — Run `agent-army deploy` to provision infrastructure with Pulumi
3. **Manage** — Use `agent-army status`, `ssh`, and `validate` to monitor your fleet

## Agent Presets

| Preset | Name | Role | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| `pm` | Marcus | Project Manager | Break down tickets, research, plan and sequence work |
| `eng` | Titus | Engineer | Lead engineering, coding, shipping |
| `tester` | Scout | Tester | Quality assurance, verification, bug hunting |

Each agent runs on its own server with persistent EBS/volume storage, pre-configured with OpenClaw and all necessary tools.
