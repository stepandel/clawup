# Agent Army

Agent Army deploys a team of [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) AI agents on your own cloud infrastructure — AWS or Hetzner — that persistently work through your Linear tickets. A product manager, an engineer, and a QA tester, running 24/7 on dedicated servers, coordinating through Linear and GitHub to ship real work.

## Why Agent Army?

You have a Linear backlog full of tickets. Agent Army gives you a dedicated team that picks them up, breaks them down, writes the code, opens PRs, reviews them, and files bugs — without you babysitting the process.

Each agent has a specific role, persistent memory, and the tools to do its job: Linear for ticket tracking, GitHub for code, Claude Code for engineering, and Slack for communication.

## The Team

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Marcus" icon="compass">
    **Product Manager** — Breaks down Linear tickets into actionable sub-tasks, researches requirements, sequences work, and keeps the team unblocked.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Titus" icon="code">
    **Engineer** — Picks up tickets, writes code with Claude Code, opens PRs on GitHub, and responds to review feedback.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scout" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **QA Tester** — Reviews PRs, tests changes against acceptance criteria, files bugs back to Linear, and verifies fixes.
  </Card>

Each agent runs on its own dedicated server with persistent storage, pre-configured with OpenClaw, Claude Code, and all necessary integrations (Linear, GitHub, Slack).

## How It Works

1. **Configure** — Run `agent-army init` to set up your cloud provider, select agents, and connect Linear/GitHub
2. **Deploy** — Run `agent-army deploy` to provision your team on dedicated servers
3. **Assign work** — Point your agents at Linear tickets and they coordinate the rest
4. **Monitor** — Use `agent-army status`, `ssh`, and `validate` to check on your team
