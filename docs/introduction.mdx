title: "What is Agent Army?"
description: "Deploy a fleet of autonomous AI agents on your own cloud infrastructure"
---

Agent Army deploys autonomous [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) AI agents on your own cloud infrastructure — AWS or Hetzner. Each agent is defined by a composable **identity** that packages personality, skills, model preferences, and tool configuration into a self-contained, reusable unit. Agents run 24/7 on dedicated servers, coordinating through integrations like Linear, GitHub, and Slack.

## Why Agent Army?

You define _what_ your agents do through identities. Agent Army handles _where_ and _how_ they run — provisioning servers, installing tools, configuring networking, and keeping agents operational.

Each agent has a specific role, persistent memory, and the tools to do its job. Use the built-in identities to get started, or create your own for any role you need.

## Built-in Team

Agent Army ships with three built-in identities that form a complete software development team:

  <Card title="Juno" icon="compass">
    **Product Manager** — Breaks down Linear tickets into actionable sub-tasks, researches requirements, sequences work, and keeps the team unblocked.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Titus" icon="code">
    **Engineer** — Picks up tickets, writes code with Claude Code, opens PRs on GitHub, and responds to review feedback.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scout" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **QA Tester** — Reviews PRs, tests changes against acceptance criteria, files bugs back to Linear, and verifies fixes.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

These are standard identities hosted in a Git repo — the same format as any custom identity you'd create.

## How It Works

1. **Configure** — Run `agent-army init` to set up your cloud provider, select identities (built-in, Git repo, or local), and connect integrations
2. **Deploy** — Run `agent-army deploy` to provision your agents on dedicated servers
3. **Assign work** — Move tickets through your Linear workflow and agents pick them up automatically. The [Linear plugin](/integrations/linear#linear-plugin) watches for ticket state changes and routes them into per-agent queues — each agent's [queue handler](/architecture/identities#how-agents-coordinate) processes tickets end-to-end
4. **Monitor** — Use `agent-army status`, `ssh`, and `validate` to check on your agents
