title: "Juno — Product Manager"
description: "How Juno breaks down tickets, prepares implementation prompts, and keeps the team unblocked"
---

Juno is the **Product Manager** of your Agent Army. She takes high-level Linear tickets and breaks them down into actionable, well-scoped sub-tasks that Titus can pick up and implement.

## What Juno Does

- Monitors Linear for unrefined tickets assigned to her
- Breaks down tickets into sized, sequenced sub-tasks
- Researches requirements and gathers context from the codebase
- Generates implementation prompts so Titus knows exactly what to build
- Flags tickets that are missing descriptions or acceptance criteria
- Assigns prepped tickets to Titus and moves them to "To Do"

## Heartbeat

Juno's heartbeat fires every minute and follows a simple loop:

1. **Check Linear** for assigned tickets in "Todo" or "Backlog" that haven't been prepped yet
2. **Prep each ticket** using the `linear-ticket-prep` skill — a multi-phase workflow that sizes the ticket, researches context, and generates an implementation prompt
3. **Flag gaps** — if any ticket is missing a description or acceptance criteria, flag it and ask the assigner for clarification
4. **Hand off** — once a ticket is prepped, assign it to Titus and move it to "To Do"

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `linear-ticket-prep` | Multi-phase ticket preparation — sizing, research, context gathering, and prompt generation |

## Workspace Files

Juno's behavior is defined by workspace files injected into `~/.openclaw/workspace/` during bootstrap:

| File | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| `SOUL.md` | Core personality — approach, values, superpowers, boundaries. Defines who Juno *is* as a PM. |
| `IDENTITY.md` | Name, role label, emoji, avatar metadata. |
| `HEARTBEAT.md` | The state machine logic executed every minute (described above). |
| `TOOLS.md` | Tool-specific notes and common commands for Juno's workflow. |

She also receives the shared base files (`USER.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `BOOTSTRAP.md`) that all agents share.

## Configuration

Juno uses the `pm` preset in your manifest:

```json
{
  "name": "agent-pm",
  "displayName": "Juno",
  "role": "pm",
  "preset": "pm",
  "volumeSize": 30
}
```

| Field | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `preset` | `pm` | Built-in PM preset |
| `volumeSize` | 30 GB | Persistent storage — Juno doesn't need as much since she's not cloning large repos |
| `instanceType` | Provider default | Override if needed |
| `envVars` | — | Add agent-specific environment variables |

## Customization

You can customize Juno by editing the preset files in the `presets/` directory, or by overriding fields in the manifest. To create a completely custom PM agent, set `preset: null` and provide your own `soulContent` and `identityContent`. See [Agent Roles & Customization](/architecture/agent-presets#customization) for details.
