title: "Titus — Engineer"
description: "How Titus picks up tickets, writes code, opens PRs, and iterates on review feedback"
---

Titus is the **Engineer** of your Agent Army. He picks up prepped tickets from Linear, writes code using Claude Code, opens pull requests on GitHub, and iterates on review feedback until the work is merged.

## What Titus Does

- Picks up prioritized engineering tickets from Linear
- Writes code using Claude Code on a dedicated server
- Runs typechecks, builds, and tests before opening PRs
- Opens pull requests on GitHub and assigns Scout for review
- Responds to PR review comments and pushes fixes
- Manages multiple tickets in parallel with a state machine
- Alerts the owner on Slack when stuck or hitting repeated failures

## Heartbeat

Titus runs a state machine that tracks multiple tickets in parallel via `memory/agent-state.json`. His heartbeat fires every minute:

1. **Circuit breaker** — if 3+ consecutive errors have occurred, notify the owner on Slack and stop. This prevents runaway failures.
2. **Process active work** — loop through each item in `activeWork` and act based on its state:
   - **`AGENT_RUNNING`** — Claude Code is implementing the ticket. If stuck for 3+ cycles, comment on Linear and alert the owner. If finished, transition to `BUILD_CHECK`.
   - **`BUILD_CHECK`** — run typecheck, build, and e2e tests. On pass: create a PR, assign Scout for review, move the ticket to "In Review", transition to `AWAITING_REVIEW`. On fail (under 3 attempts): spawn Claude Code to fix, go back to `AGENT_RUNNING`. On fail (3+ attempts): create a draft PR with the failure summary.
   - **`AWAITING_REVIEW`** — check if the PR is merged. If yes, rebase dependent branches and remove from active work. Otherwise, do nothing.
   - **`IDLE_BLOCKED`** — waiting on a dependency. If the blocking ticket's PR is merged, rebase and transition to `AGENT_RUNNING`.
3. **Pick up new work** — if fewer than 2 items are actively running, check Linear for the next prioritized ticket, add it to `activeWork`, and spawn Claude Code to start implementation.

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `eng-ticket-workflow` | Structured ticket implementation workflow |
| `eng-pr-tester` | PR testing workflow |
| `pr-review-resolver` | PR review comment resolution |

## Workspace Files

Titus's behavior is defined by workspace files injected into `~/.openclaw/workspace/` during bootstrap:

| File | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| `SOUL.md` | Core personality — approach, values, superpowers, boundaries. Defines who Titus *is* as an engineer. |
| `IDENTITY.md` | Name, role label, emoji, avatar metadata. |
| `HEARTBEAT.md` | The state machine logic executed every minute (described above). |
| `TOOLS.md` | Tool-specific notes and common commands for Titus's workflow. |

He also receives the shared base files (`USER.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `BOOTSTRAP.md`) that all agents share.

## Configuration

Titus uses the `eng` preset in your manifest:

```json
{
  "name": "agent-eng",
  "displayName": "Titus",
  "role": "eng",
  "preset": "eng",
  "volumeSize": 50
}
```

| Field | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `preset` | `eng` | Built-in engineer preset |
| `volumeSize` | 50 GB | Larger volume — Titus clones repos and runs builds |
| `instanceType` | Provider default | Override for compute-heavy workloads |
| `envVars` | — | Add agent-specific environment variables |

## Customization

You can customize Titus by editing the preset files in the `presets/` directory, or by overriding fields in the manifest. To create a completely custom engineer agent, set `preset: null` and provide your own `soulContent` and `identityContent`. See [Agent Roles & Customization](/architecture/agent-presets#customization) for details.
