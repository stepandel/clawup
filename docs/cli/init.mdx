---

Interactive setup wizard that walks you through configuring your cloud provider, secrets, and agent team.

## Usage

```bash
clawup init [options]
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--deploy` | Deploy immediately after init completes |
| `-y, --yes` | Skip confirmation prompt (used with `--deploy`) |
| `--env-file <path>` | Path to `.env` file (defaults to `.env` in project root) |

## Wizard Steps

### 1. Stack Name
Choose a unique name for your deployment (e.g., `dev`, `prod`, `staging`). This becomes part of your Tailscale hostnames and resource tags.

### 2. Cloud Provider
Select your cloud provider:
- **AWS** — Amazon Web Services EC2 instances
- **Hetzner** — Hetzner Cloud servers (EU/US)

### 3. Region
Choose a deployment region. Options are provider-specific:

**AWS:** us-east-1, us-east-2, us-west-2, eu-west-1, eu-central-1, ap-southeast-1, ap-northeast-1

**Hetzner:** fsn1 (Falkenstein), nbg1 (Nuremberg), hel1 (Helsinki), ash (Ashburn)

### 4. Instance Type
Select server size. Affects performance and cost.

### 5. Owner Configuration
- **Name** — Your name (used in agent onboarding)
- **Timezone** — e.g., `America/New_York`
- **Working hours** — e.g., `9am-6pm`

### 6. Agent Selection
Pick from built-in identities, point to a Git repo or local directory, or mix both.

### 7. API Keys & Secrets
Configure required credentials (Anthropic API key, provider keys, etc.).

### 8. Review & Confirm
Review your full configuration with cost estimates before saving.

## Examples

```bash
# Standard interactive init
clawup init

# Init and deploy immediately
clawup init --deploy

# Init, deploy, skip confirmation
clawup init --deploy --yes
```

## `.env` File Support

If a `.env` file exists in the project root (or is specified via `--env-file`), the wizard loads it before prompting for secrets. Any values found in the `.env` file are used automatically, skipping the interactive prompt for that secret.

The init command also generates a `.env.example` alongside `clawup.yaml`, listing all required env var names with empty values. Copy it to `.env` and fill in values for a prompt-free experience on subsequent runs.

See [Environment Variables](/configuration/environment) for full details on the `${env:VAR}` reference system.

## Output

Creates `clawup.yaml` in your current directory with the full manifest, along with a `.clawup/` workspace directory and `.env.example` file (`.clawup/` and `.env` are added to `.gitignore` automatically).
