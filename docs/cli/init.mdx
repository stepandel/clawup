| `-y, --yes` | Skip confirmation prompt (used with `--deploy`) |

## Wizard Steps

### 1. Stack Name
Choose a unique name for your deployment (e.g., `dev`, `prod`, `staging`). This becomes part of your Tailscale hostnames and resource tags.

### 2. Cloud Provider

- **AWS** — Amazon Web Services EC2 instances
- **Hetzner** — Hetzner Cloud servers (EU/US)

### 3. Region
Choose a deployment region. Options are provider-specific:

**AWS:** us-east-1, us-east-2, us-west-2, eu-west-1, eu-central-1, ap-southeast-1, ap-northeast-1

**Hetzner:** fsn1 (Falkenstein), nbg1 (Nuremberg), hel1 (Helsinki), ash (Ashburn)

### 4. Instance Type
Select server size. Affects performance and cost.

### 5. Owner Configuration
- **Name** — Your name (used in agent onboarding)
- **Timezone** — e.g., `America/New_York`
- **Working hours** — e.g., `9am-6pm`

### 6. Agent Selection
Pick from built-in identities, point to a Git repo or local directory, or mix both.

### 7. API Keys & Secrets
Configure required credentials (Anthropic API key, provider keys, etc.).

### 8. Review & Confirm
Review your full configuration with cost estimates before saving.

# Standard interactive init
