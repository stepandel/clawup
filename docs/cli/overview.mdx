The Clawup CLI is the primary interface for managing your agent team: setup, deployment, monitoring, access, and teardown.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g clawup
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [`init`](/cli/init) | Interactive setup wizard — configure stack, secrets, and agents |
| [`deploy`](/cli/deploy) | Deploy agents with Pulumi |
| [`status`](/cli/status) | Show agent statuses from stack outputs |

## Global Options

```bash

clawup --help       # Show help
clawup <cmd> --help # Show command-specific help
```

## Project-Based Config

Every deployment lives in a project directory with `clawup.yaml` at its root. Run commands from within your project directory and the CLI auto-detects the config.
