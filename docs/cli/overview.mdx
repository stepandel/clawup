The Clawup CLI is the primary interface for managing your agent team: setup, deployment, monitoring, access, and teardown.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g clawup
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [`init`](/cli/init) | Generate clawup.yaml scaffold (or refresh existing config from identity changes) |
| [`setup`](/cli/setup) | Validate secrets from `.env` and configure Pulumi |
| [`deploy`](/cli/deploy) | Deploy agents with Pulumi |

clawup --help       # Show help

## Project-Based Config

Every deployment lives in a project directory with `clawup.yaml` at its root. Run commands from within your project directory and the CLI auto-detects the config.
