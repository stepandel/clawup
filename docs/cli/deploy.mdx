title: "deploy"
description: "Deploy your agent team with Pulumi"
---

Provisions infrastructure and deploys your agent team using Pulumi.

## Usage

```bash
clawup deploy [options]
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-y, --yes` | Skip confirmation prompt |
| `-c, --config <name>` | Config name (auto-detected if only one) |

## What It Does

1. Reads your `clawup.yaml` manifest
2. Runs `pulumi up` to provision/update infrastructure
3. Creates servers, volumes, networking, and security groups
4. Bootstraps each agent with OpenClaw and configured tools
5. Connects agents to your Tailscale network

## Examples

```bash
# Deploy with confirmation
clawup deploy

# Deploy without confirmation
clawup deploy --yes

# Deploy a specific config
clawup deploy -c production
```

<Note>
First deployment takes 3-5 minutes. Subsequent deployments are incremental — only changes are applied.
</Note>

<Warning>
Deployment creates cloud resources that incur costs. Review your config and cost estimates before deploying.
