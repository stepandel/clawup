title: "deploy"
description: "Validate secrets, configure Pulumi, and deploy your agent team"
---

Validates your `.env` secrets, configures the Pulumi stack, and provisions infrastructure for your agent team — all in a single command.

## Usage

```bash
clawup deploy [options]
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-y, --yes` | Skip confirmation prompt |
| `--local` | Deploy to local Docker containers instead of cloud |
| `--env-file <path>` | Path to `.env` file (defaults to `.env` in project root) |
| `--skip-hooks` | Skip plugin lifecycle hook execution |

## What It Does

1. **Validates secrets** — Loads `.env`, resolves `${env:VAR}` references, validates formats, and reports any missing secrets
2. **Fetches identities** — Resolves agent identities from Git repos or local paths
3. **Auto-resolves secrets** — Fetches Linear user UUIDs and other auto-resolvable values
4. **Configures Pulumi** — Creates/selects the stack and sets all config values
5. **Provisions infrastructure** — Runs `pulumi up` to create servers, volumes, networking, and security groups
6. **Bootstraps agents** — Installs OpenClaw, tools, and configured integrations on each agent
7. **Connects to Tailscale** — Joins agents to your Tailscale network

<Note>
In previous versions, steps 1-4 were handled by a separate `clawup setup` command. As of v2.6.0, `deploy` handles everything automatically.
</Note>

## Local Docker Mode

Use `--local` to run agents in local Docker containers for testing:

```bash
clawup deploy --local
```

This creates a separate Pulumi stack (`<stackName>-local`), copies config from your cloud stack (skipping Tailscale keys), and runs agents locally. No cloud resources are created.

## Examples

```bash
# Deploy with confirmation
clawup deploy

# Deploy without confirmation
clawup deploy --yes

# Deploy with custom .env location
clawup deploy --env-file /path/to/.env

# Deploy to local Docker containers
clawup deploy --local --yes
```

<Note>
First deployment takes 3-5 minutes. Subsequent deployments are incremental — only changes are applied.
</Note>

<Warning>
Deployment creates cloud resources that incur costs. Review your config and cost estimates before deploying.
</Warning>
