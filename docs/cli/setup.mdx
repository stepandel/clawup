<Warning>
**Deprecated.** `clawup deploy` now handles setup automatically. This command is kept for backward compatibility (CI scripts, etc.) and will be removed in a future version.
</Warning>

Reads `clawup.yaml` and your `.env` file, validates all required secrets are present, fetches Linear user UUIDs, and configures the Pulumi stack.

## Usage

```bash
clawup setup [options]
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--env-file <path>` | Path to `.env` file (defaults to `.env` in project root) |
| `--deploy` | Deploy immediately after setup completes |
| `-y, --yes` | Skip confirmation prompt (used with `--deploy`) |
| `--skip-hooks` | Skip plugin lifecycle hook execution |
| `--onboard` | Run plugin onboard hooks during setup |

## Migration

Replace any usage of `clawup setup` with `clawup deploy`:

```bash
# Before
clawup setup
clawup deploy

# After
clawup deploy
```

If you used `clawup setup --deploy`, just use `clawup deploy` instead.

## Examples

```bash
# Still works, but shows deprecation warning
clawup setup

# Setup and deploy in one step (equivalent to `clawup deploy`)
clawup setup --deploy -y
```
