Runs plugin onboard hooks interactively. Onboard hooks are plugin-defined scripts that handle first-time setup tasks like creating webhook endpoints, generating signing secrets, or configuring external services.

## Usage

```bash
clawup onboard [options]
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--env-file <path>` | Path to `.env` file (defaults to `.env` in project root) |

## What It Does

1. Loads `clawup.yaml` and resolves agent identities
2. Loads `.env` and resolves secrets
3. Runs each plugin's `onboard` hook (if defined) with the resolved context
4. Hooks can prompt for input, call external APIs, and write results back to config

## When to Use

Run `clawup onboard` after your first `clawup deploy` if any plugins have onboard hooks that need interactive setup. For example, a plugin might need to register webhook URLs that are only available after deployment.

You can also pass `--onboard` to `clawup setup` to run onboard hooks during the setup phase.

## Examples

```bash
# Run onboard hooks
clawup onboard

# Run with custom .env location
clawup onboard --env-file /path/to/.env
```

<Note>
Onboard hooks are defined by plugin authors in the plugin manifest. Not all plugins have onboard hooks — only those that require interactive first-time configuration.
