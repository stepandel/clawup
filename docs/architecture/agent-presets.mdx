# Agent Presets

Agent Army ships with three agent presets that form a complete team for tackling your Linear backlog.

## Available Presets

### Marcus — Product Manager (`pm`)

- **Volume:** 30 GB
- **What he does:** Picks up Linear tickets and breaks them into actionable sub-tasks. Researches requirements, sequences work across the team, updates ticket status, and keeps Titus and Scout unblocked. Communicates progress via Slack.
- **Tools:** Linear, GitHub, Slack, web search
- **Best for:** Ticket breakdown, backlog management, research, cross-agent coordination

### Titus — Engineer (`eng`)

- **Volume:** 50 GB
- **What he does:** Picks up engineering tickets from Linear, writes code using Claude Code, creates branches and opens PRs on GitHub. Responds to review comments and iterates until the PR is approved. Updates Linear ticket status as work progresses.
- **Tools:** Claude Code, GitHub, Linear, build tools, testing frameworks
- **Best for:** Implementing features, fixing bugs, writing tests, shipping PRs

### Scout — QA Tester (`tester`)

- **Volume:** 30 GB
- **What she does:** Reviews PRs on GitHub, tests changes against the ticket's acceptance criteria (happy path, sad path, edge cases). Files bugs back to Linear with reproduction steps. Verifies fixes after they land.
- **Tools:** GitHub, Linear, testing frameworks, browser automation
- **Best for:** PR review, manual and automated testing, bug filing, fix verification

## Configuration

Each agent is defined in the manifest as an `AgentDefinition`:

```typescript
interface AgentDefinition {
  name: string;          // Resource name (e.g., "agent-pm")
  displayName: string;   // Human name (e.g., "Marcus")
  role: string;          // Role identifier
  preset: string | null; // Preset name or null for custom
  volumeSize: number;    // Persistent storage in GB
  instanceType?: string; // Override instance type
  envVars?: Record<string, string>; // Extra env vars
}
```

## Customization

You can customize preset agents during init:

- **Volume size** — Adjust persistent storage
- **Instance type** — Override the default server size
- **Environment variables** — Add agent-specific config

## Custom Agents

Set `preset: null` and provide custom `soulContent` and `identityContent` to create agents with completely custom personalities and roles.
