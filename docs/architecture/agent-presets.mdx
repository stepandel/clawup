# Agent Roles & Customization

Agent Army ships with three presets that form a complete team. Each preset defines the agent's personality, tools, and workflow through a set of workspace files.

## Built-In Presets

| Preset | Agent | Role | Volume |
|--------|-------|------|--------|
| `pm` | Juno | Product Manager — breaks down tickets, coordinates work, communicates via Slack | 30 GB |
| `eng` | Titus | Engineer — writes code, opens PRs, iterates on review feedback | 50 GB |
| `tester` | Scout | QA Tester — reviews PRs, tests changes, files bugs back to Linear | 30 GB |

For full role descriptions, see the [Introduction](/introduction).

## How Agents Coordinate

Agents coordinate asynchronously through Linear and GitHub — there's no direct agent-to-agent communication:

```
Linear Ticket
     │
     ▼
Juno (PM) ── breaks down into sub-tasks
     │
     ▼
Titus (Eng) ── picks up engineering tickets, opens PRs
     │
     ▼
Scout (QA) ── reviews PRs, tests changes, files bugs
     │
     ▼
Titus (Eng) ── fixes bugs, iterates until approved
```

Each agent runs a **heartbeat** every minute that checks for new work:
- **Juno** checks Linear for unrefined tickets to break down
- **Titus** checks Linear for assigned engineering tickets, then checks GitHub for PR review comments
- **Scout** checks GitHub for PRs ready for review, then checks Linear for verification tasks

## Workspace Files

Each agent's behavior is defined by workspace files injected into `~/.openclaw/workspace/` during bootstrap.

### Per-Preset Files

| File | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| `SOUL.md` | Core personality — approach, values, superpowers, boundaries, vibe. This is who the agent *is*. |
| `IDENTITY.md` | Name, role label, emoji, avatar. Short identification metadata. |
| `HEARTBEAT.md` | State machine logic executed every minute. Defines what the agent checks for and how it transitions between states (idle → working → blocked → done). |
| `TOOLS.md` | Tool-specific notes and common commands. Cheat sheet for the agent's toolchain. |

### Shared Base Files

These files are shared across all presets:

| File | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| `USER.md` | Owner information — name, timezone, working hours, custom notes. Personalized from template variables. |
| `AGENTS.md` | Operational instructions shared by all agents — memory management, safety rules, group chat etiquette, heartbeat protocol. |
| `BOOTSTRAP.md` | First-run checklist — verifies integrations (Linear, GitHub, Claude Code) work, then deletes itself. |

### Skills

Reusable skill files provide specialized workflows:

| Skill | Used By | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `linear-ticket-prep` | PM | Multi-phase ticket preparation — sizing, research, context gathering, prompt generation |
| `eng-ticket-workflow` | Engineer | Structured ticket implementation workflow |
| `eng-pr-tester` | Engineer | PR testing workflow |
| `pr-review-resolver` | Engineer | PR review comment resolution |

## Template Variables

Workspace files with `.tpl` extensions support template variables that get replaced at deploy time:

| Variable | Description | Example Value |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| `{{OWNER_NAME}}` | Your name | `Boss` |
| `{{TIMEZONE}}` | Your timezone | `PST (America/Los_Angeles)` |
| `{{WORKING_HOURS}}` | Your working hours | `9am-6pm` |
| `{{USER_NOTES}}` | Custom notes for agents | `No additional notes provided yet.` |
| `{{LINEAR_TEAM}}` | Linear team identifier | `AGE` |
| `{{GITHUB_REPO}}` | Target repository | `org/repo` |

These are set during `agent-army init` and stored in the manifest.

## Customization

All preset files live in the `presets/` directory. If you clone the repo locally, you can edit any `.md` file directly — change an agent's personality, tweak its heartbeat logic, or adjust its tool notes. Your changes will be picked up on the next deploy.

You can also customize agents in the manifest:

```typescript
interface AgentDefinition {
  name: string;          // Resource name (e.g., "agent-pm")
  displayName: string;   // Human name (e.g., "Juno")
  role: string;          // Role identifier
  preset: string | null; // Preset name or null for custom
  volumeSize: number;    // Persistent storage in GB
  instanceType?: string; // Override instance type
  envVars?: Record<string, string>; // Extra env vars
}
```

### What You Can Change

- **Volume size** — Adjust persistent storage per agent (e.g., engineers may need more for large repos)
- **Instance type** — Override the default server size (e.g., `t3.large` for compute-heavy agents)
- **Environment variables** — Add agent-specific config via `envVars`

## Custom Agents

To create an agent with a completely custom role, set `preset: null` and provide custom content:

- **`soulContent`** — Your custom SOUL.md content defining the agent's personality and role
- **`identityContent`** — Your custom IDENTITY.md content with name and metadata

The agent still gets the shared base files (USER.md, AGENTS.md, BOOTSTRAP.md) and the full bootstrap stack (Docker, Node.js, Claude Code, etc.). You're customizing *who the agent is*, not how it's provisioned.
