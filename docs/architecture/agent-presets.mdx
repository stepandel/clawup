Agent Army ships with three presets that form a complete team. Each preset defines the agent's personality, tools, and workflow through a set of workspace files.

## Built-In Presets

| Preset | Agent | Role | Volume |
|--------|-------|------|--------|
| `pm` | Juno | Product Manager — breaks down tickets, coordinates work, communicates via Slack | 30 GB |
| `eng` | Titus | Engineer — writes code, opens PRs, iterates on review feedback | 50 GB |
| `tester` | Scout | QA Tester — reviews PRs, tests changes, files bugs back to Linear | 30 GB |

For full role descriptions, see the [Introduction](/introduction).

## How Agents Coordinate

Agents coordinate asynchronously through Linear and GitHub — there's no direct agent-to-agent communication. Work is driven by the **[openclaw-linear plugin](/integrations/linear#linear-plugin)**, which watches for Linear ticket state changes via webhooks and routes tickets into per-agent queues.

```
Linear Ticket (state change)
     │
     ▼
openclaw-linear plugin (webhook)
     │
     ├── Backlog/Unstarted → Juno's queue
     ├── Backlog/Started   → Titus's queue
     └── Started           → Scout's queue
     │
     ▼
Queue handler skill runs automatically
     │
     ├── Juno: preps ticket, assigns to Titus
     ├── Titus: delegates to Claude Code, opens PR, assigns Scout
     └── Scout: reviews PR, runs tests, reports results
```

When a ticket changes state in Linear, the plugin adds or removes it from the appropriate agent's queue. Each agent has a **queue handler skill** that processes inbound tickets end-to-end.

## Workspace Files

Each agent's behavior is defined by workspace files injected into `~/.openclaw/workspace/` during bootstrap.

### Per-Preset Files

| File | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| `SOUL.md` | Core personality — approach, values, superpowers, boundaries, vibe. This is who the agent *is*. |
| `IDENTITY.md` | Name, role label, emoji, avatar. Short identification metadata. |
| `HEARTBEAT.md` | Periodic checklist executed every minute. Handles bootstrap detection and any polling-based tasks not covered by the Linear plugin queue. |
| `TOOLS.md` | Tool-specific notes and common commands. Cheat sheet for the agent's toolchain. |

### Shared Base Files

These files are shared across all presets:

| File | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| `USER.md` | Owner information — name, timezone, working hours, custom notes. Personalized from template variables. |
| `AGENTS.md` | Operational instructions shared by all agents — memory management, safety rules, group chat etiquette. |
| `BOOTSTRAP.md` | First-run checklist — verifies integrations (Linear, GitHub, Claude Code) work, then deletes itself. |

### Skills

Reusable skill files provide specialized workflows:

| Skill | Used By | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `pm-queue-handler` | PM | Processes tickets from Juno's Linear queue — routes, preps, and assigns |
| `eng-queue-handler` | Engineer | Processes tickets from Titus's Linear queue — delegates to coding agent, ships PRs |
| `tester-queue-handler` | QA | Processes tickets from Scout's Linear queue — reviews PRs, runs tests, reports results |
| `linear-ticket-prep` | PM | Multi-phase ticket preparation — sizing, research, context gathering, prompt generation |
| `linear-ticket-routing` | PM | Routes tickets by labels to the appropriate workflow and assignee |
| `eng-ticket-workflow` | Engineer | Structured ticket implementation workflow |
| `eng-pr-tester` | Engineer | PR testing workflow |
| `pr-review-resolver` | Engineer, QA | PR review comment resolution |

## How Work Gets Triggered

Agent work is primarily driven by the **[openclaw-linear plugin](/integrations/linear#linear-plugin)** — an OpenClaw extension that receives Linear webhooks, maintains per-agent ticket queues, and automatically invokes queue handler skills when tickets arrive. The heartbeat still fires every minute but serves a secondary role: bootstrap detection and polling-based tasks (like Scout's PR review resolution).

### Linear Plugin Queue System

When a ticket changes state in Linear (e.g., moved to "Backlog" or "In Progress"), the plugin's webhook handler evaluates per-role routing rules to decide whether to add or remove the ticket from each agent's queue:

| Agent | Queue Adds On | Queue Removes On |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Juno** (PM) | Backlog, Unstarted | Triage, Started, Completed, Cancelled |
| **Titus** (Eng) | Backlog, Started | Triage, Completed, Cancelled |
| **Scout** (QA) | Started | Triage, Completed, Cancelled |

When a ticket is added to an agent's queue, the plugin automatically triggers that agent's **queue handler skill**:

- **`pm-queue-handler`** — Routes the ticket by labels, preps it with research/context/sizing via `linear-ticket-prep`, and assigns it to Titus
- **`eng-queue-handler`** — Delegates implementation to Claude Code, monitors progress, runs build/test checks, creates a PR, and assigns Scout for review
- **`tester-queue-handler`** — Reviews the PR against acceptance criteria, runs build/test suites, auto-fixes simple failures, and reports results on Linear

### Heartbeat

The heartbeat fires every minute and executes the agent's `HEARTBEAT.md` checklist. For most agents, this is minimal — just a bootstrap check. On first boot, the heartbeat detects `BOOTSTRAP.md` and runs first-time setup (integration verification); once bootstrap completes, the file is deleted and the regular heartbeat takes over.

**Juno and Titus** have heartbeats that only check for bootstrap — all their work is triggered by the Linear plugin queue.

**Scout** has a more active heartbeat that also handles PR review comment resolution (scanning open PRs for unresolved comments and using the `pr-review-resolver` skill to apply fixes). Queue-driven work (testing new PRs) is handled by the `tester-queue-handler` skill.

## Template Variables

Workspace files with `.tpl` extensions support template variables that get replaced at deploy time:

| Variable | Description | Example Value |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| `{{OWNER_NAME}}` | Your name | `Boss` |
| `{{TIMEZONE}}` | Your timezone | `PST (America/Los_Angeles)` |
| `{{WORKING_HOURS}}` | Your working hours | `9am-6pm` |
| `{{USER_NOTES}}` | Custom notes for agents | `No additional notes provided yet.` |
| `{{LINEAR_TEAM}}` | Linear team identifier | `AGE` |
| `{{GITHUB_REPO}}` | Target repository | `org/repo` |

These are set during `agent-army init` and stored in the manifest.

## Customization

All preset files live in the `presets/` directory. If you clone the repo locally, you can edit any `.md` file directly — change an agent's personality, adjust its queue handler workflow, or tweak its tool notes. Your changes will be picked up on the next deploy.

You can also customize agents in the manifest:

```typescript
interface AgentDefinition {
  name: string;          // Resource name (e.g., "agent-pm")
  displayName: string;   // Human name (e.g., "Juno")
  role: string;          // Role identifier
  preset: string | null; // Preset name or null for custom
  volumeSize: number;    // Persistent storage in GB
  instanceType?: string; // Override instance type
  envVars?: Record<string, string>; // Extra env vars
}
```

### What You Can Change

- **Volume size** — Adjust persistent storage per agent (e.g., engineers may need more for large repos)
- **Instance type** — Override the default server size (e.g., `t3.large` for compute-heavy agents)
- **Environment variables** — Add agent-specific config via `envVars`

## Custom Agents

To create an agent with a completely custom role, set `preset: null` and provide custom content:

- **`soulContent`** — Your custom SOUL.md content defining the agent's personality and role
- **`identityContent`** — Your custom IDENTITY.md content with name and metadata

The agent still gets the shared base files (USER.md, AGENTS.md, BOOTSTRAP.md) and the full bootstrap stack (Docker, Node.js, Claude Code, etc.). You're customizing *who the agent is*, not how it's provisioned.
