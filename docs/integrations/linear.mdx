Linear is the primary way your agents coordinate work. Juno breaks down tickets, Titus picks them up for engineering, and Scout tracks verification — all through Linear.

## What You Need

A **Linear API key** for each agent. Each agent gets its own Linear account so you can see who did what.

<Note>
Linear integration is optional but strongly recommended. Without it, agents lose the ability to track and coordinate work through tickets.
</Note>

## Step 1: Create Agent Accounts

Each agent needs its own Linear account so you can track who did what. A recommended approach is to use plus-addressing — no extra email addresses needed.

1. Go to your Linear workspace settings
2. Invite each agent using plus-addressing on your email:
   - `you+juno@yourdomain.com` (PM)
   - `you+titus@yourdomain.com` (Engineer)
   - `you+scout@yourdomain.com` (QA Tester)
3. Follow the invite links to create each account and join your workspace

<Tip>
Plus-addressing (e.g., `you+juno@gmail.com`) forwards to your inbox automatically. No new email accounts needed.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Generate API Keys

For each agent account:

1. Log into Linear as that agent
2. Go to **Settings** > **Security & Access** > **Personal API keys**
3. Click **"New API key"**
4. Copy the key — it starts with `lin_api_`

## Step 3: Provide Keys During Init

The `agent-army init` wizard prompts you for each agent's Linear API key:

```
? Linear API key for Juno (pm) lin_api_XXXXXXXXXXXX
? Linear API key for Titus (eng) lin_api_XXXXXXXXXXXX
? Linear API key for Scout (tester) lin_api_XXXXXXXXXXXX
```

Keys are stored encrypted in Pulumi config as secrets (e.g., `pmLinearApiKey`, `engLinearApiKey`).

## What Gets Installed

On each agent's server, the deploy process automatically:

1. Installs **Deno** and the **Linear CLI** (`@schpet/linear-cli`)
2. Sets `LINEAR_API_KEY` as an environment variable
3. Configures the Linear skill in OpenClaw

## How Agents Use Linear

Agents use the Linear CLI to manage tickets:

```bash
# List tickets assigned to the agent
linear issue list --filter "assignee:me"

# View ticket details
linear issue view ENG-123

# Update ticket status
linear issue update ENG-123 --state "In Progress"

# Create a sub-task
linear issue create --title "Implement auth endpoint" --team ENG --parent ENG-100
```

### By Role

| Agent | How They Use Linear |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Juno** (PM) | Breaks down tickets into sub-tasks, sequences work, assigns to Titus/Scout, tracks overall progress |
| **Titus** (Engineer) | Picks up assigned tickets, updates status as work progresses, marks done when PR is merged |
| **Scout** (QA) | Checks tickets for acceptance criteria, files bugs with reproduction steps, marks verified after fixes land |

## Manifest Configuration

Set your Linear team in the manifest so agents know which team to work with:

```json
{
  "linearTeam": "ENG"
}
```

This maps to the `{{LINEAR_TEAM}}` template variable in agent preset files.
