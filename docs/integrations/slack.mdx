Slack lets you communicate with your agents directly — assign work, ask for status updates, or get notified about progress. Each agent gets its own Slack app so messages show up under the agent's name.

## What You Need

Each agent needs two tokens:

- **Bot Token** (`xoxb-...`) — lets the agent read and send messages
- **App Token** (`xapp-...`) — enables Socket Mode for real-time communication

<Note>
Slack integration is optional. Without it, agents can still work through Linear and GitHub but won't be able to communicate with you in real time.
</Note>

## Step 1: Create a Slack App

Repeat this for each agent (Juno, Titus, Scout).

1. Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Click **"Create New App"** > **"From a manifest"**
3. Select your workspace
4. Paste the manifest for the agent you're setting up (expand below)

<Tip>
The `agent-army init` wizard copies the correct manifest to your clipboard automatically when you reach the Slack setup step.

5. Click **"Create"**

## Step 2: Get the Bot Token

1. In your new app's settings, go to **OAuth & Permissions**
2. Click **"Install to Workspace"** and approve
3. Copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** — it starts with `xoxb-`

## Step 3: Get the App Token

1. Go to **Basic Information** > **App-Level Tokens**
2. Click **"Generate Token and Scopes"**
3. Name it (e.g., `socket-mode`)
4. Add the scope: `connections:write`
5. Click **"Generate"**
6. Copy the token — it starts with `xapp-`

## Step 4: Provide Tokens During Init

The `agent-army init` wizard prompts for both tokens per agent:

```
? Slack Bot Token for Juno (pm) xoxb-XXXXXXXXXXXX
? Slack App Token for Juno (pm) xapp-XXXXXXXXXXXX
```

Tokens are stored encrypted in Pulumi config as secrets (e.g., `pmSlackBotToken`, `pmSlackAppToken`).

## How Agents Use Slack

Agents connect to Slack via **Socket Mode** — no public URLs or webhook endpoints needed. They can:

- Respond to DMs and mentions
- Post updates to channels
- React to messages
- Read channel history for context

### By Role

| Agent | How They Use Slack |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Juno** (PM) | Reports progress, shares ticket breakdowns, responds to questions about priorities and status |
| **Titus** (Engineer) | Shares PR links, asks for clarification on requirements, reports blockers |
| **Scout** (QA) | Reports test results, shares bug details, confirms fixes |

<Tip>
Juno treats Slack as the primary communication channel. If you want to give instructions or check on progress, message Juno directly.
