# Prerequisites

Before using Agent Army, ensure you have the following tools and accounts set up.

## Required Tools

| Tool | Version | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Node.js** | 18+ | Runtime for CLI and Pulumi |
| **Pulumi CLI** | Latest | Infrastructure provisioning |
| **Tailscale** | Latest | Secure mesh networking |

### Install Pulumi

```bash
# macOS
brew install pulumi/tap/pulumi

# Linux
curl -fsSL https://get.pulumi.com | sh

# Verify
pulumi version
```

### Install Tailscale

```bash
# macOS
brew install tailscale

# Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
```

## Cloud Provider Setup

You need credentials for at least one cloud provider.

### AWS

Requires the AWS CLI installed and configured with credentials:

```bash
# Install AWS CLI
brew install awscli  # or: pip install awscli

# Configure credentials
aws configure
```

Required permissions: EC2, EBS, VPC, Security Groups, IAM.

### Hetzner

No CLI required — just an API token with Read & Write permissions. The `agent-army init` wizard will prompt you for it.

Get your API token from the [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/) under Project > Security > API Tokens.

## API Keys

### Anthropic Claude

You'll need an Anthropic API key for your agents. A subscription to the **Max plan** is recommended — agents run continuously and can burn through standard API credits quickly.

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
```

Get one at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/).

## Verify Setup

Run the init wizard — it checks prerequisites automatically:

```bash
agent-army init
```

<Warning>
Missing prerequisites will be flagged during init. Install them before proceeding.
</Warning>
