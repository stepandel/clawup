# Quick Start

Get a fleet of AI agents running on your own infrastructure in minutes.

## 1. Install

```bash
npm install -g agent-army
```

## 2. Check Prerequisites

Make sure you have the required tools installed:

- **Node.js** 18+
- **Pulumi CLI** — [Install guide](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/install/)
- **AWS CLI** or **Hetzner CLI** — depending on your provider
- **Tailscale** — [Install guide](https://tailscale.com/download)

<Tip>
Run `agent-army validate` after deployment to verify all agents are healthy.
</Tip>

## 3. Initialize

```bash
agent-army init
```

The interactive wizard walks you through:

1. **Stack name** — A unique name for your deployment (e.g., `dev`, `prod`)
2. **Cloud provider** — AWS or Hetzner
3. **Region** — Where to deploy your servers
4. **Instance type** — Server size (affects cost)
5. **Owner info** — Your name, timezone, working hours
6. **Agent selection** — Pick from presets (PM, Engineer, Tester)
7. **Review** — Confirm config and estimated costs

## 4. Deploy

```bash
agent-army deploy
```

Pulumi provisions your infrastructure: servers, volumes, networking, and agent bootstrap.

<Note>
First deployment takes 3-5 minutes. Subsequent deployments are incremental.
</Note>

## 5. Connect

```bash
# Check status
agent-army status

# SSH to an agent
agent-army ssh titus

# Validate health
agent-army validate
```
