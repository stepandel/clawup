Get AI agents running on your own cloud infrastructure in minutes.

## 1. Install

```bash
npm install -g clawup
```

## 2. Check Prerequisites

Make sure you have the required tools installed:

- **Node.js** 18+
- **Pulumi CLI** — [Install guide](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/install/)
- **AWS CLI** — if deploying to AWS ([Install guide](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/))
- **Tailscale** — installed and connected to your tailnet ([Install guide](https://tailscale.com/download))

<Tip>
Run `clawup validate` after deployment to verify all agents are healthy.
</Tip>

## 3. Create or Discover Identities

If you don't have identities yet, scaffold one with [`army-create`](https://github.com/stepandel/army-create):

```bash
npx army-create
```

Then initialize your deployment:

```bash
clawup init
```

Discovers local identity directories and generates a `clawup.yaml` manifest and `.env.example` with sensible defaults (AWS, us-east-1).

## 4. Edit Your Config

Open `clawup.yaml` and customize:
- **stackName** — unique deployment name (e.g., `dev`, `prod`)
- **provider** — `aws` or `hetzner`
- **region** — where to deploy
- **instanceType** — server size
- **ownerName**, **timezone**, **workingHours** — your info
- **agents** — add, remove, or modify agents

## 5. Fill in Secrets

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in your API keys (Anthropic, Tailscale, etc.).

## 6. Setup

```bash
clawup setup
```

Validates all secrets are present, fetches Linear user UUIDs (if needed), and configures the Pulumi stack. If any secrets are missing, it prints exactly what's needed.

## 7. Deploy

```bash
clawup deploy
```

Pulumi provisions your agents: dedicated servers, persistent storage, networking, and bootstrap with all integrations.

<Note>
First deployment takes 3-5 minutes. Subsequent deployments are incremental.
</Note>

## 8. Connect

```bash
# Check status
clawup status

# SSH to an agent
clawup ssh <agent-name>

# Validate health
clawup validate
```
