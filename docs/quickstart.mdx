Get AI agents running on your own cloud infrastructure in minutes.

## 1. Install

```bash
npm install -g clawup
```

## 2. Check Prerequisites

Make sure you have the required tools installed:

- **Node.js** 18+
- **Pulumi CLI** — [Install guide](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/install/)
- **AWS CLI** — if deploying to AWS ([Install guide](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/))
- **Tailscale** — installed and connected to your tailnet ([Install guide](https://tailscale.com/download))

<Tip>
Run `clawup validate` after deployment to verify all agents are healthy.
</Tip>

## 3. Initialize

```bash
clawup init
```

The interactive wizard walks you through:

1. **Stack name** — A unique name for your deployment (e.g., `dev`, `prod`)
2. **Cloud provider** — AWS or Hetzner
3. **Region** — Where to deploy your servers
4. **Instance type** — Server size (affects cost)
5. **Owner info** — Your name, timezone, working hours
6. **Agent selection** — Pick from built-in identities, point to a Git repo or local directory, or mix both
7. **Review** — Confirm config and estimated costs

This generates a `clawup.yaml` manifest and sets all Pulumi config values automatically.

## 4. Deploy

```bash
clawup deploy
```

Pulumi provisions your agents: dedicated servers, persistent storage, networking, and bootstrap with all integrations.

<Note>
First deployment takes 3-5 minutes. Subsequent deployments are incremental.
</Note>

## 5. Connect

```bash
# Check status
clawup status

# SSH to an agent
clawup ssh <agent-name>

# Validate health
clawup validate
```
